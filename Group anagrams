'''An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of a different word,
typically using all the original letters exactly once.
For example, anagrams of word cat are tac, act.
Given an array of words, write a function to return a group anagrams.
Input: List of words
Sample Input: [“tar”, “State”, “rat”, “art”, “Taste”, “dream”]
Sample Output: [[‘state’, ‘taste’], [‘dream’], [‘tar’, ‘rat’, ‘art’]]'''


def groupAnagrams(words):
    
      result = {}
      for i in words:
         x = "".join(sorted(i)) //sorts the word alphabetically
         if x in result:      //the keys in dict are sorted alphabetical words and the values are all the words that match with it
            result[x].append(i)
         else:
            result[x] = [i]
      return list(result.values())
